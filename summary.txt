The Smart Recipe Generator is a web-based application designed to help users create meals using the ingredients they already have. Users can input ingredients either as text or via image uploads. The system leverages an ingredient recognition algorithm combined with a recipe matching logic to suggest multiple recipes, each including detailed steps, nutritional information, and serving adjustments. The interface is clean, intuitive, and fully mobile-responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices. The project includes a predefined database of recipes across multiple cuisines and is deployed on a free hosting platform, making it accessible online. Key focus areas include ingredient classification, error handling, and a responsive UI, implemented with production-quality, maintainable code.
